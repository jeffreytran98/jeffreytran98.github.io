                    <p> Hey! Thanks for stopping by my website! I'm Jeffrey, a UC Berkeley alumni (c/o 2021) where I earned a Bachelors in Cognitive Science and a Minor in Data Science! During my time at Berkeley, I played mellophone in the Cal Band and was team captain for our Division 1 CS:GO & Valorant team. </p>
                    <p> Early Career: My first full-time job was as a Search Associate/Recruiting Coordinator, for Frederickson Partners, one of the best Executive Search Firms out there. I've always wanted to explore the tech space and found Embark Trucks, an AI Trucking company based in San Francisco, California, where I started as a Recruiting Coordinator. Unfortunately, a few months after I joined Embark, they decided to pause hiring efforts. I was moved to a different part of the company where I could utilize my technical skill. I was moved to our Deep Learning Data QA team where I worked closely with Machine Learning Engineers and other QA Specialists. Feel free to check out my resume (linked above and below) to see my accomplishments here. On March 3rd, 2023, Embark Trucks announced a company wide layoff that affected 70% of us. </p>
                    <p> Currently: So what am I up to now? Ultimately, my time at Embark has reignited my love and passion to work with code. I took a small break after being laid off but I've recently started to hone in on my technical skills to become a potential analyst or software engineer by taking courses on UDemy, LeetCoding, and working on Personal Projects such as this website you are currently on. (Feel free to click the GitHub icon linked below to see what I've been up to) </p>
