                    <p> Hey! Thanks for stopping by my website! I'm Jeffrey, a UC Berkeley alumni (c/o 2021) where I earned a Bachelors in Cognitive Science and a Minor in Data Science! During my time at Berkeley, I played mellophone in the Cal Band and was team captain for our Division 1 CS:GO & Valorant team. </p>
                    <p> Early Career: Writing "Early Career" is funny to me because of how young I am in my career. My first full-time job was as a Search Associate, essentially a Recruiting Coordinator, for Frederickson Partners, one of the best Executive Search Firms out there. After about, I wanted to explore the tech space and found Embark Trucks, an AI Trucking company based in San Francisco, California, where I worked as a Recruiting Coordinator. Unfortunately, my time as an RC was shortlived as the Company decided to pause hiring efforts during our hyper-growth stage only a few months in. As a result, myself and a handful of others were moved to different parts of the company. I was moved to our Deep Learning Data QA team where I worked closely with Machine Learning Engineers and other QA Specialists. I was able to utilize my technical experience I had gained from undergrad for the first time by writing python scripts and performed data analysis tasks. I was learning so much everyday but everything came to an abrupt stop on March 3rd, 2023 when Embark Trucks announced a company wide layoff that affected 70% of us. </p>
                    <p> Currently: So what am I up to now? Ultimately, my time at Embark has reignited my love and passion to work with code. I took a small break after being laid off but I've recently started to hone in on my technical skills to become a potential analyst or software engineer by taking courses on UDemy, LeetCoding, and working on Personal Projects such as this website you are currently on. (Feel free to click the GitHub icon linked below to see what I've been up to) </p>
